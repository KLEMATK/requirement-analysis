“What is Requirement Analysis?”
 
 “Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”

1. Ensures Clear Understanding of Project Goals
Requirement analysis helps all stakeholders—developers, clients, and users—understand exactly what the software is supposed to do. By clearly defining the functional and non-functional requirements early on, the development team can avoid ambiguity, misinterpretation, and confusion, ensuring the final product aligns with business objectives.

2. Reduces Development Costs and Rework
Identifying requirements at the beginning of the project helps prevent costly errors and unnecessary rework later. If a requirement is missed or misunderstood, correcting it during the development or testing phase can be expensive and time-consuming. Early analysis allows issues to be caught and resolved when they are easiest and cheapest to fix.

3. Improves Product Quality and User Satisfaction
Requirement analysis ensures the final product meets user needs and expectations. By capturing detailed input from stakeholders, the software is more likely to function correctly, be user-friendly, and solve real-world problems effectively—leading to higher satisfaction and better adoption among users.
