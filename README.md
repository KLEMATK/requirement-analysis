“Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”

“What is Requirement Analysis?”.
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to guide the design and development of software systems. This phase acts as the foundation for all subsequent stages of the SDLC, including design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

 “Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”
  It is important because, it help in building effective, efficient, and successful software systems that meet user needs and business goals.
  Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. Prevents Costly Errors and Rework
Poorly understood or incomplete requirements often lead to mistakes in design and development, which can be expensive to fix later.
2. Improves Communication and Alignment
Requirement Analysis acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team.
3. Serves as a Foundation for Design, Development, and Testing
Clear, well-documented requirements guide all subsequent phases of the SDLC.
