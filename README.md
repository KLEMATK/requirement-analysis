“Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”

“What is Requirement Analysis?”.
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to guide the design and development of software systems. This phase acts as the foundation for all subsequent stages of the SDLC, including design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

 “Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”
  It is important because, it help in building effective, efficient, and successful software systems that meet user needs and business goals.
  Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is important in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. Prevents Costly Errors and Rework
Poorly understood or incomplete requirements often lead to mistakes in design and development, which can be expensive to fix later.
2. Improves Communication and Alignment
Requirement Analysis acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team.
3. Serves as a Foundation for Design, Development, and Testing
Clear, well-documented requirements guide all subsequent phases of the SDLC.

“Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.”
1. Requirement Gathering
Definition:
Requirement Gathering is the initial step where all potential sources of requirements are identified, and information is collected from stakeholders.
Purpose:
To understand the problem domain, business needs, and what users expect the software to accomplish.
Key Activities:
•	Identifying stakeholders (e.g., clients, users, project managers).
•	Collecting raw information through documents, legacy systems, or existing processes.
•	Reviewing business goals and industry regulations.
Importance:
It lays the foundation for all other activities. Without complete input, the software may miss critical features or fail to meet expectations.
2. Requirement Elicitation
Definition:
Elicitation is the process of drawing out the actual requirements from stakeholders using systematic techniques.
Purpose:
To uncover both explicit and implicit needs, which stakeholders may not articulate clearly on their own.
Common Techniques:
•	Interviews
•	Questionnaires
•	Brainstorming sessions
•	Workshops
•	Observation
•	Use case analysis
•	Prototyping
Importance:
Ensures that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the problem and solution space, avoiding assumptions and misunderstandings.
3. Requirement Documentation
Definition:
Requirement Documentation involves writing down the gathered and elicited requirements in a structured and clear format.
Purpose:
To create an official record (often the Software Requirements Specification – SRS) that guides the project team throughout the development lifecycle.
Key Elements of Documentation:
•	Functional requirements (e.g., system behaviors)
•	Non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security)
•	Constraints and assumptions
•	Use cases or user stories
Importance:
Provides a reference point for developers, testers, and stakeholders, ensuring transparency, accountability, and consistency.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Definition:
This activity involves examining the documented requirements for clarity, completeness, feasibility, and consistency, and then modeling them to represent system behavior and interactions.
Purpose:
To break down and organize requirements logically and visually for easier understanding and validation.
Common Modeling Tools:
•	Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
•	Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
•	Use Case Diagrams
•	State diagrams
•	UML models
Importance:
It helps detect conflicting, vague, or missing requirements and supports better design and system architecture.
5. Requirement Validation
Definition:
Validation is the process of ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the business needs and are achievable within scope and constraints.
Purpose:
To confirm that the right requirements have been captured and that they are feasible, testable, and acceptable to stakeholders.
Validation Methods:
•	Reviews and walkthroughs
•	Prototyping and simulations
•	Test case derivation
•	Approval sign-offs by stakeholders
Importance:
It helps eliminate misunderstandings and ensures that the final product meets user expectations, reducing the risk of project failure.

Conclusion
These five activities form a comprehensive cycle that ensures software projects are built on solid, user-centered foundations. When done correctly, they help deliver solutions that are not only functional but also aligned with business goals and user satisfaction.
 “Types of Requirements."

"Functional Requirements."

Functional requirements describe the specific operations and behaviors the Booking Management System must perform. These include actions users can take, how the system responds, and the processes it automates.
Examples for the Booking Management Project:
•	Users must be able to create, modify, and cancel bookings through the web interface.
•	The system shall allow administrators to approve or reject booking requests.
•	Customers should receive email or SMS confirmations after booking is completed.
•	The system must validate availability before confirming a booking.
•	Logged-in users should be able to view their upcoming and past bookings.

"Non-functional Requirements."
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the Booking Management System. They specify how well the system performs under various conditions rather than what it does.
Examples for the Booking Management Project:
•	The system should respond to user actions within 2 seconds under normal load.
•	The application must support 24/7 availability with 99.9% uptime.
•	All booking data must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS, AES).
•	The system should scale to handle up to 5,000 concurrent users during peak hours.
•	The interface must be mobile-responsive and support accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).
